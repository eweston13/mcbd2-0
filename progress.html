	<p>In the past two weeks, the team has begun elaborating on our design and performing a technical analysis. A major change has been changing the single large rod in the spherical wheel to several smaller rods spaced evenly about the surface of the ball.</p>

	<p>The team has determined a number of calculations will need to be performed to ensure our design meets our own metrics. The first set is a kinematic analysis to ensure the ball drive will function correctly while navigating inclines and small obstacles. Secondly, a number of CAD studies will be conducted to determine the load carrying capacity of the ball drive and the weight of the ball drive itself. Third, research will be performed on magnetic Halbach arrays to determine how to arrange the magnets on our design for optimal magnetic coupling. Finally, a bill of materials will be assembled and a final cost of the ball drive will be determined.</p>
	
	<h2 class="section-header">10.7.2021 - Phase 1 Summary</h2>
	<p>At the start of our project, the team performed some background research into existing products and potential issues, in order to inform our design process. We found that while spherical ball drives have existed as early as the 1950's, the idea was largely ignored due to poor performance. Simultaneously, the team developed a set of product needs and corresponding metrics for our design to meet. These metrics defined the size of the ball drive, the load carrying capacity, ease of manufacturing, cost, and operational performance.</p>
	<p>With this background material, the team began generating design concepts for the three subsystems of the ball drive: the drive system, the spherical wheel, and the internal structure. These subconcepts were then combined into several design concepts. Several design concepts were screened out based on our metrics, and we were left with three finalist concepts: the Twist & Lock, the Bottom Omni-Wheel, and the Induced Omni-Wheel. Finally, the finalist designs were more precisely scored against our metrics, and the Induced Omni-Wheel design was selected.</p>
